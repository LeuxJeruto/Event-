		<h2>Multimedia University of Kenya </h2>
		
			<p> Multimedia University is an institution with busy schedules every day throughout the week. 
				The reason behind this is that the University has various faculties with multiple courses in them. 
				Also, there are always functions that normally occur within the school perimeter, utilizing the resources within the institution. 
				
			</p>

			<p>These resources include venues, chairs for the audience as well as devices such as the projectors. 
				However, in most cases, there are inconveniences that arise due to failure to allocate these resources for these events.
				The project therefore is an event planning system whereby these issues are solved in order to reduce the average time wait for resources. 
				
			</p>

			<p>A system is created that will allocate the resources for certain events within the school to ensure that each faculty,
				 course and other organizations
				 have all necessities needed by the time the event is starting
